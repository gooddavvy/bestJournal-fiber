# How to Contribute

If you like this app and think about contributing, then open an issue with the body of something like this:

```markdown
### request:Contribute

I would like to contribute to BestJournal because I found this bug: ...
```

Don't forget to replace "I would like to contribute to BestJournal because I found this bug: ..." with your own opinion.

If I say something like:

"

### response:Approved

Sure, you can now open a pull request to fix the issue. If it works, I will approve the PR. Thank you so much for your support! :D

Have a good day :)
"

That means that you will be allowed to open a PR and fix or write code for your opinion. Otherwise, if the response is "Mistaken", it means that you can't.
